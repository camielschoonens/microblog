There is a lot of value here for a large group of consumers. Given the power of Apple Silicon this will be a very powerful laptop for most users. The Mac still has no touch screen, compared to for instance Windows laptops today, but I guess that‚Äôs because macOS isn‚Äôt ready for it (yet). A touch screen in a MacBook would probably also eat away margin from the iPad Pro segment which Apple doesn‚Äôt want.</li>\n\t<li>The updates to Phone App are nice but for my usage not needed. I guess the ‚Äòposter‚Äô functionality would be something I setup once and then just forget.</li>\n\t<li>Live voicemail probably needs to be supported by the operator and by language. Given that visual voicemail still hasn‚Äôt arrived with Vodafone in the Netherlands I‚Äôm not expecting anything soon on this.</li>\n\t<li>I appreciate the updates to the ‚ÄòMessages‚Äô app, I wish more people would use it over WhatsApp so I could get rid of WhatsApp completely.</li>\n\t<li>NameDrop is cool, makes perfect sense. I hope it‚Äôs more reliable then AirDrop.</li>\n\t<li>Inline text predictions, yes please.</li>\n\t<li>Journal is nice but I prefer DayOne for this, especially when DayOne incorporates the provided API to capture for instance my exercises.</li>\n\t<li>Standby is appreciated, I hope it works well with focus mode so that you can link specific widgets to standby mode. I already have the needed [stand](https://www.twelvesouth.com/products/forte-for-iphone) next to my bed. It wasn‚Äôt mentioned but I guess you need an iPhone with an always on display for this.</li>\n\t<li>Interactive widgets are finally here. This is typical Apple, calling something a feature that should of been part of the initial release. The iPadOS lock screen looks amazing, I like the vertical setup of widgets.</li>\n\t<li>Desktop widgets in macOS. Amazing how Apple is bringing continuity across the iPhone, iPad and Mac. I already see myself using Flighty, Things and Fantastical widgets on my desktop. Interesting to see that Craig Federighi wasn‚Äôt doing his demo using Stage Manager, did Apple already give up on it?</li>\n\t<li>Creating web apps from Safari is something I will use often. This functionality will replace my current [Unite 4](https://www.bzgapps.com/unite) setup.</li>\n\t<li>FaceTime on Apple TV using continuity camera is nicely done. Would be nice if could watch Formula 1 with friends like this.</li>\n\t<li>Creating workouts on your iPhone is a welcomed feature as the current approach is WatchOS only and really not easy to setup. My understanding is that with WatchOS 10 it‚Äôs now possible through third party apps that support the API.</li>\n\t<li>No comments on VisionPro except that it‚Äôs very cool product engineering. The threshold for adopting such a device is far too high for me for now. I am curious on the first reviews though.</li>\n</ul>\n",
