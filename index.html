<p>Going back home after two days with my team in Stockholm. This was the last trip to the Nordics before my summer holidays.

<p>This quote from a now-departed and respected Jewish teacher is powerful, because&hellip;</p>
<p>Many of us belong to communities that are based on the consolidation of power and control by those who claim to &ldquo;lead&rdquo; the community. These aren&rsquo;t true leaders. Leadership isn&rsquo;t about keeping power or control: it&rsquo;s about giving it to others. This is why the practice of improvisation is so important: we practice giving to others, not taking or controlling for ourselves.</p>
<p>If you belong to a community where the &ldquo;leader&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t actually understand true leadership, trust your instincts. Find a different community that&rsquo;s aligned with your humanity, ethics, values and morals. And if you can&rsquo;t find one: start one. Others will join you because you are never alone. In fact, you might be the very spark that others need to experience in order to shift. Give gifts and then don&rsquo;t stop giving.</p>
<p>Via <a href="https://mastodon.social/@changethroughplay">@changethroughplay</a> and very inspirational after a tough day in the office today.</p>

<p>I decided to read this book based on a recommendation from a fellow young adult parent. This is not my type of book.

			 <p>Finished reading: <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781787303782">Killing Moon</a> by Jo NesbÃ¸ ðŸ“š</p>
<p>I enjoyed reading the newest thriller in the â€˜Harry Holeâ€™ series a lot. Maybe this is even the best book until date with a great plot twist and a more or less open end for future books on the last page.</p>
<p>Next to the amazing thriller storytelling that NesbÃ¸ does, I like the music references that are being made throughout the different books, including this one with references to Nirvana and Fleetwood Mac amongst others.</p>
<p>If you liked the previous books on Hole then for sure read this one too. If you havenâ€™t read the previous books then donâ€™t start with this one as there are far too many references and characters in here that you wonâ€™t understand.</p>
<p>For reference, this is the full series (13 books till date) in order:</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve been measuring my solar panel production in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Home Assistant<!-- raw HTML omitted --> ever since the panels were installed and I really like the insights that this has been giving me on a daily basis.</p>
<p>Home Assistant has a really nice build-in energy dashboard in which I was able to capture the total produced power of all my solar panels combined by default. This in itself already gave good insights on the daily production but I wanted to refine the insights a bit more as I have two groups of solar panels, one group facing east, one group facing west. You can imagine that depending on the day and season the production on the east and west side of the house differs.</p>
<p>When going through the Home Assistant sensors that my inverter &lsquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->SMA Solar<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&rsquo; provides I noticed that there are actually Watt (W) sensors available for each of the panel groups. These sensors just weren&rsquo;t showing up as source data for the energy dashboard.</p>
<p>After some reading on the internet I figured out that the reason that I can&rsquo;t add these sensors to the default energy dashboard is because it expects kilowatt (kWh) sensors. Once you know this it&rsquo;s relatively easy to convert W to kWh with the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Riemann sum integral integration<!-- raw HTML omitted --> in Home Assistant with the code below.</p>

<p>All you need to do is add the above code (adjusted to your personal source sensor naming) in your configuration.yaml. You will need one platform integration per source sensor. After saving your yaml file and rebooting Home Assistant you can add the new sensors (sensor.energy_produced_east_panels and sensor.energy_produced_west_panels) to your Energy Dashboard resulting in the solar production view below.</p>
