I'm using WebCatalog over the default <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/nl/app/home-assistant/id1099568401\">Home Assistant Mac app</a> as a presonal prefference, you could achieve the same resized view in the Home Assistant app too I guess.\n\nThe different cards on the dashboard are aligned in three columns, I use the 'vertical-stack' card for this. Within the 'vertical-stack' I use 'horizontal-stack' to align the buttons on the first row. All other cards are using the maximum space available within the vertical stack-card. \n\nNow letâ€™s go over the three columns from left to right and from top to bottom:\n\nColumn 1\n<ul>\n\t<li>A row with '<a href=\"https://community.home-assistant.io/t/mushroom-cards-build-a-beautiful-dashboard-easily/388590\">Mushroom Cards</a>' for my three main light groups in and around the house.</li>\n\t<li>A '<a href=\"https://github.com/custom-cards/bar-card\">Vertical Bar Chart</a>' based on a custom sensor that is counting the amount of days annualy that I'm producing more energy compared to what I'm using from the grid. I call this 'Netneutraal' or grid neutral.</li>\n\t<li>A '<a href=\"https://github.com/RomRider/apexcharts-card\">Apex Chart Card</a>' that shows the energy produced through my solar pannels. I'm using Apex Charts so that I can also show the offset of the total production on the day before today.</li>\n\t<li>Another '<a href=\"https://github.com/RomRider/apexcharts-card\">Apex Chart Card</a>', this one is showing the temperatuur in- and outside of the house. The graph shows the past 24 hours from the current hour back.</li>\n</ul>\n\nColumn 2\n<ul>\n\t<li>A row with two '<a href=\"https://community.home-assistant.io/t/mushroom-cards-build-a-beautiful-dashboard-easily/388590\">Mushroom Cards</a>' showing the thermostat temperature in the house and the current status of the car charger.</li>\n\t<li>A '<a href=\"https://github.com/custom-cards/bar-card\">Vertical Bar Chart</a>' based on a custom sensor that is counting the amount of days annualy that I'm producing more energy compared to the total energy I've consumed that day. I call this 'Energieneutraal' or energy neutral. This is different from being grid neutral but you will need to read this twice to figure that out.</li>\n\t<li>A '<a href=\"https://github.com/RomRider/apexcharts-card\">Apex Chart Card</a>' that shows the energy consumed since the day started. The grey lines shows the energy consumed pattern of the day before.</li>\n\t<li>A '<a href=\"https://github.com/RomRider/apexcharts-card\">Apex Chart Card</a>' that shows the gas consumed since the day started. The grey lines shows the gas consumed pattern of the day before.</li>\n</ul>\n\nColumn 3\n<ul>\n\t<li>Yet another row with '<a href=\"https://community.home-assistant.io/t/mushroom-cards-build-a-beautiful-dashboard-easily/388590\">Mushroom Cards</a>'. These two cards show me if there is a Home Assistant update available and if my Synology NAS is up-to-date with the latest software. Clicking on these cards open the change log of the latest update.</li>\n\t<li>The third and last'<a href=\"https://github.com/custom-cards/bar-card\">Vertical Bar Chart</a>' on the dashboard. This one shows the amount of money spend on charging my car at home. The sensor gets resetted through an automation on January 1st.</li>\n\t<li>Another '<a href=\"https://github.com/RomRider/apexcharts-card\">Apex Chart Card</a>' showing the electricity prices per hour. Usefull for me as I use these prices to automate my car charging.</li>\n\t<li>Another custom card, this one is called '<a href=\"https://github.com/thomasloven/lovelace-template-entity-row\">Entity-Row</a>' which I use together with '<a href=\"https://github.com/thomasloven/lovelace-auto-entities\">Auto Entities</a>' to automatically sort the entities shown (Waste collection types) by date. This card is based on a custom component called '<a href=\"https://github.com/xirixiz/homeassistant-afvalwijzer\">Afvalwijzer</a>', very useful for Home Assistant users living in the Netherlands.</li>\n</ul>\n",

To get everyone up to speed, at WWDC14, in the early days of the transition from OS's named after big cats (Lion, Jaguar, Tiger, Leopard, etc.) to places in California, Craig Federighi joked about Apple's \"Crack Marketing Team\" driving around California in search of the next name for OS X. Before unveiling OS X Yosemite; Apple teased about considering OS X Oxnard, OS X Weed, and yes, OS X Rancho Cucamonga.</blockquote>\n\n<p>Yet again a stunning wallpaper for all your Apple devices from <a href=\"https://basicappleguy.com/\">Basic Apple Guy</a>.
