Reddit’s recent decisions and actions have unfortunately made it impossible for Apollo to continue. Thank you so, so much for all the support over the years.</blockquote>\n\n<p>This paying for API usage is becoming the ‘sign of the times’, first with Twitter now with Reddit. While I don’t use Reddit often, I do use Apollo when I read Reddit. It’s a really good app by an Indie developer and it’s sad to see such a good product go. The thread on how the talks between Apollo and Reddit went is worth the read.</p>\n",

There is a lot of value here for a large group of consumers. Given the power of Apple Silicon this will be a very powerful laptop for most users. The Mac still has no touch screen, compared to for instance Windows laptops today, but I guess that’s because macOS isn’t ready for it (yet). A touch screen in a MacBook would probably also eat away margin from the iPad Pro segment which Apple doesn’t want.</li>\n\t<li>The updates to Phone App are nice but for my usage not needed. I guess the ‘poster’ functionality would be something I setup once and then just forget.</li>\n\t<li>Live voicemail probably needs to be supported by the operator and by language. Given that visual voicemail still hasn’t arrived with Vodafone in the Netherlands I’m not expecting anything soon on this.</li>\n\t<li>I appreciate the updates to the ‘Messages’ app, I wish more people would use it over WhatsApp so I could get rid of WhatsApp completely.</li>\n\t<li>NameDrop is cool, makes perfect sense. I hope it’s more reliable then AirDrop.</li>\n\t<li>Inline text predictions, yes please.</li>\n\t<li>Journal is nice but I prefer DayOne for this, especially when DayOne incorporates the provided API to capture for instance my exercises.</li>\n\t<li>Standby is appreciated, I hope it works well with focus mode so that you can link specific widgets to standby mode. I already have the needed [stand](https://www.twelvesouth.com/products/forte-for-iphone) next to my bed. It wasn’t mentioned but I guess you need an iPhone with an always on display for this.</li>\n\t<li>Interactive widgets are finally here. This is typical Apple, calling something a feature that should of been part of the initial release. The iPadOS lock screen looks amazing, I like the vertical setup of widgets.</li>\n\t<li>Desktop widgets in macOS. Amazing how Apple is bringing continuity across the iPhone, iPad and Mac. I already see myself using Flighty, Things and Fantastical widgets on my desktop. Interesting to see that Craig Federighi wasn’t doing his demo using Stage Manager, did Apple already give up on it?</li>\n\t<li>Creating web apps from Safari is something I will use often. This functionality will replace my current [Unite 4](https://www.bzgapps.com/unite) setup.</li>\n\t<li>FaceTime on Apple TV using continuity camera is nicely done. Would be nice if could watch Formula 1 with friends like this.</li>\n\t<li>Creating workouts on your iPhone is a welcomed feature as the current approach is WatchOS only and really not easy to setup. My understanding is that with WatchOS 10 it’s now possible through third party apps that support the API.</li>\n\t<li>No comments on VisionPro except that it’s very cool product engineering. The threshold for adopting such a device is far too high for me for now. I am curious on the first reviews though.</li>\n</ul>\n",

Within the 'vertical-stack' I use 'horizontal-stack' to align the buttons on the first row. All other cards are using the maximum space available within the vertical stack-card. \n\nNow let’s go over the three columns from left to right and from top to bottom:\n\nColumn 1\n<ul>\n\t<li>A row with '<a href=\"https://community.home-assistant.io/t/mushroom-cards-build-a-beautiful-dashboard-easily/388590\">Mushroom Cards</a>' for my three main light groups in and around the house.</li>\n\t<li>A '<a href=\"https://github.com/custom-cards/bar-card\">Vertical Bar Chart</a>' based on a custom sensor that is counting the amount of days anualy that I'm producing more energy compared to what I'm using from the grid. I call this 'Netneutraal' or grid neutral.</li>\n\t<li>A '<a href=\"https://github.com/RomRider/apexcharts-card\">Apex Chart Card</a>' that shows the energy produced through my solar panels. I'm using Apex Charts so that I can also show the offset of the total production on the day before today.</li>\n\t<li>Another '<a href=\"https://github.com/RomRider/apexcharts-card\">Apex Chart Card</a>', this one is showing the temperature in- and outside of the house. The graph shows the past 24 hours from the current hour back.</li>\n</ul>\n\nColumn 2\n<ul>\n\t<li>A row with two '<a href=\"https://community.home-assistant.io/t/mushroom-cards-build-a-beautiful-dashboard-easily/388590\">Mushroom Cards</a>' showing the thermostat temperature in the house and the current status of the car charger.</li>\n\t<li>A '<a href=\"https://github.com/custom-cards/bar-card\">Vertical Bar Chart</a>' based on a custom sensor that is counting the amount of days anualy that I'm producing more energy compared to the total energy I've consumed that day. I call this 'Energieneutraal' or energy neutral. This is different from being grid neutral but you will need to read this twice to figure that out.</li>\n\t<li>A '<a href=\"https://github.com/RomRider/apexcharts-card\">Apex Chart Card</a>' that shows the energy consumed since the day started. The grey lines shows the energy consumed pattern of the day before.</li>\n\t<li>A '<a href=\"https://github.com/RomRider/apexcharts-card\">Apex Chart Card</a>' that shows the gas consumed since the day started. The grey lines shows the gas consumed pattern of the day before.</li>\n</ul>\n\nColumn 3\n<ul>\n\t<li>Yet another row with '<a href=\"https://community.home-assistant.io/t/mushroom-cards-build-a-beautiful-dashboard-easily/388590\">Mushroom Cards</a>'. These two cards show me if there is a Home Assistant update available and if my Synology NAS is up-to-date with the latest software. Clicking on these cards open the change log of the latest update.</li>\n\t<li>The third and last'<a href=\"https://github.com/custom-cards/bar-card\">Vertical Bar Chart</a>' on the dashboard. This one shows the amount of money spend on charging my car at home. The sensor gets a reset through an automation on January 1st.</li>\n\t<li>Another '<a href=\"https://github.com/RomRider/apexcharts-card\">Apex Chart Card</a>' showing the electricity prices per hour. Useful for me as I use these prices to automate my car charging.</li>\n\t<li>Another custom card, this one is called '<a href=\"https://github.com/thomasloven/lovelace-template-entity-row\">Entity-Row</a>' which I use together with '<a href=\"https://github.com/thomasloven/lovelace-auto-entities\">Auto Entities</a>' to automatically sort the entities shown (Waste collection types) by date. This card is based on a custom component called '<a href=\"https://github.com/xirixiz/homeassistant-afvalwijzer\">Afvalwijzer</a>', very useful for Home Assistant users living in the Netherlands.</li>\n</ul>\n",
