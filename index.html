<p>This quote from a now-departed and respected Jewish teacher is powerful, because&hellip; Many of us belong to communities that are based on the consolidation of power and #control by those who claim to &ldquo;lead&rdquo; the community. These aren&rsquo;t true leaders. Leadership isn&rsquo;t about keeping power or control: it&rsquo;s about giving it to others. This is why the practice of improvisation is so important: we practice giving to others, not taking or controlling for ourselves.</p>
<p>If you belong to a community where the &ldquo;leader&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t actually understand true leadership, trust your instincts. Find a different community that&rsquo;s aligned with your humanity, ethics, values and morals. And if you can&rsquo;t find one: start one. Others will join you because you are never alone. In fact, you might be the very spark that others need to experience in order to shift. Give gifts and then don&rsquo;t stop giving.</p>
<p>Via <a href="https://mastodon.social/@changethroughplay">@changethroughplay</a> and very inspirational after a tough day in the office today.</p>

			 <p>Finished reading: <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9789083157627">Help, ik heb een puber!</a> by Kluun (is Raymond van de Klundert.) 📚</p>
<p>I decided to read this book based on a recommendation from a fellow young adult parent. This is not my type of book. From my perspective there is too much story telling and not enough &lsquo;cutting the chase&rsquo;. The book could have been half the size and still share the same message and advice.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m proud of my 15 year old son who saved enough money to buy himself his first little motorboat today. He is fortunate enough to live next to open water here in the Netherlands, so the boat is &lsquo;parked&rsquo; in front of the house and will be used a lot this summer by him and his friends.</p>

<p>A great view from the water in Amsterdam taken last night just before sunset. It seems we are finally getting into Spring here in the Netherlands.</p>
<p>I was in Amsterdam for a lovely diner with former colleagues at &lsquo;<a href="https://www.gebr-hartering.nl">Restaurant Gebr. Hartering</a>&rsquo;. I can highly recommend the place.</p>

			 <p>I though it would be nice to post a longer personal introduction here similar to the one I have written on personal website <a href="https://camiel.schoonens.nl/about/">camiel.schoonens.nl</a>.</p>
<h4 id="introduction">Introduction</h4>
<p>My journey in life started 1978 in the south of the Netherlands. I don’t know a lot about my time in that region of the country anymore as we moved around quite a lot as family in the ‘80’s and ‘90’s. Together with my parents and two siblings, we lived in several different places in the Netherlands and in the USA.</p>
<p>My experience in the USA as a young teenager formed me more in life then I would have expected at the time it happened. I’m certain that it’s one of the main reasons of why I like working in international environments today.</p>
<p>Today I’m living in the lovely town of <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Oudewater&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbs=isz:l&amp;hl=nl&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CAIQpwVqFwoTCOCU9p3nq_8CFQAAAAAdAAAAABAD&amp;biw=1523&amp;bih=763">Oudewater</a>. I&rsquo;m living here since 2006 with my wife and family and it’s the place I always love returning too from any travel that I do.</p>
<h4 id="my-hobbies-and-personal-interests-are-in-random-order">My hobbies and personal interests are (in random order):</h4>
<p>☀️🏖️🏂🚴🏻📸🖥️👨🏼‍💻👨‍👩‍👧‍👦🍇🍻🤓🏃🏻‍♂️🏑🏎️📚</p>
<ul>
<li>Beach holidays(☀️🏖️), at least once a year in the summer and when possible I’ll try to catch some sun around Christmas too. My favorite holiday destinations till date are: France, Italy and the Dutch Caribbean. My wish is to add South-, Thailand and Sweden to this list very soon.</li>
<li>I like to snowboard (🏂) in winter season, both with family and with friends.</li>
<li>Cycling (🚴🏻) isn’t something that I do often these days but I still enjoy reading about cycling a lot. There is a form of romance around this sport that I really appreciate.</li>
<li>Photography (📸) is something I like to practice since the mid-nineties. I make most photo’s during my holidays and business travel. I take photo’s with both my iPhone and my Canon EOS R camera. With the latter I appreciate working with prime lenses (35mm, 50mm, 85mm) the most.</li>
<li>I’m an Apple fan boy (🖥️) and I love my work (👨🏼‍💻).</li>
<li>I read a lot about Product, Technology, Organizational Change and Innovation to stay up to date with my knowledge (🤓).</li>
<li>I’m a father to three children and I’m happily married since 2007 (👨‍👩‍👧‍👦). As I work and travel a lot I choose to spend the remaining time with my family and friends consciously. I enjoy drinking a good glas of wine (🍇) or beer(🍻) and my favorite recipe’s come from the Italian and Indonesian kitchen.</li>
<li>If I would be practicing a team sport it would be field hockey (🏑) again. Nowadays I’m at the hockey club every weekend with my children and I try to visit some matches of our Dutch National Team (m/f) a few times a year.</li>
<li>I started running (🏃🏻‍♂️) in 2016 as it’s hard for me to combine work with a team sport. I try to run 2 to 3 times a week and I use a running schedule to practice with a reason and goal. I ran 5 half a marathons in the year of 2017, my fastest time for this distance is 1.43.27.</li>
<li>Formule 1 (🏎️) is my favorite sport on TV. For me this is the sport where man, machine, technology and innovation come together at it’s best. I’ve been following Formule 1 since the late 80’s thanks to my father and grandfather.</li>
<li>I read (📚) quite a lot and a least every night before I go to bed. Reading helps me relax and end the day. I read just about anything, from science articles to novels and from biographies on remarkable people to thrillers.</li>
</ul>

<p>One of the nice things of living on the European continent; Everything is relatively close by.</p>
<p>I woke up this morning at 06:15 in my own bed in the Netherlands, travelled by high speed train through 3 countries, arrived in Paris at 11:00 for two days of work and enjoyed a nice diner and a city walk this evening with a friend who happens to be here too.</p>

			 <p>Finished reading: <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781787303782">Killing Moon</a> by Jo Nesbø 📚</p>
<p>I enjoyed reading the newest thriller in the ‘Harry Hole’ series a lot. Maybe this is even the best book until date with a great plot twist and a more or less open end for future books on the last page.</p>
<p>Next to the amazing thriller storytelling that Nesbø does, I like the music references that are being made throughout the different books, including this one with references to Nirvana and Fleetwood Mac amongst others.</p>
<p>If you liked the previous books on Hole then for sure read this one too. If you haven’t read the previous books then don’t start with this one as there are far too many references and characters in here that you won’t understand.</p>
<p>For reference, this is the full series (13 books till date) in order:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Up next on my reading list: <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9789024597130">The newest novel in the &lsquo;Munch &amp; Krüger&rsquo; series</a> by Samuel Björk to be released next week on May 30th in the Netherlands.</p>

			 <p>This is my latest iteration of my Home Assistant Dashboard.</p>
<p>The dashboard is arranged in three columns and I view it on my MacBook through a custom WebCatalog app. I&rsquo;m using WebCatalog over the default Home Assistant Mac app as a personal preference, you could achieve the same resized view in the Home Assistant app too I guess.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The different cards on the dashboard are aligned in three columns, I use the &lsquo;vertical-stack&rsquo; card for this. Within the &lsquo;vertical-stack&rsquo; I use &lsquo;horizontal-stack&rsquo; to align the buttons on the first row. All other cards are using the maximum space available within the vertical stack-card.</p>
<p>Now let’s go over the three columns from left to right and from top to bottom:</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve been measuring my solar panel production in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Home Assistant<!-- raw HTML omitted --> ever since the panels were installed and I really like the insights that this has been giving me on a daily basis.</p>
<p>Home Assistant has a really nice build-in energy dashboard in which I was able to capture the total produced power of all my solar panels combined by default. This in itself already gave good insights on the daily production but I wanted to refine the insights a bit more as I have two groups of solar panels, one group facing east, one group facing west. You can imagine that depending on the day and season the production on the east and west side of the house differs.</p>
<p>When going through the Home Assistant sensors that my inverter &lsquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->SMA Solar<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&rsquo; provides I noticed that there are actually Watt (W) sensors available for each of the panel groups. These sensors just weren&rsquo;t showing up as source data for the energy dashboard.</p>
<p>After some reading on the internet I figured out that the reason that I can&rsquo;t add these sensors to the default energy dashboard is because it expects kilowatt (kWh) sensors. Once you know this it&rsquo;s relatively easy to convert W to kWh with the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Riemann sum integral integration<!-- raw HTML omitted --> in Home Assistant with the code below.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>All you need to do is add the above code (adjusted to your personal source sensor naming) in your configuration.yaml. You will need one platform integration per source sensor. After saving your yaml file and rebooting Home Assistant you can add the new sensors (sensor.energy_produced_east_panels and sensor.energy_produced_west_panels) to your Energy Dashboard resulting in the solar production view below.</p>
